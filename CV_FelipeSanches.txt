== Projects ==
=== Pense Bem / Smart Start web-based simulator ===
 February 2011
 Members: Felipe C. da S. Sanches and Leandro Pereira

 It began as an experiment in reverse engineering and the desire to write an emulator. Ended up with a simulator written in JavaScript, using SVG and HTML5 audio for a classic 90's toy ("PenseBem" was marketed as "SmartStart" in the USA and Canada).

=== Metamáquina 2 ===
 August 2012
 Members: Felipe C. da S. Sanches and Rodrigo Rodrigues da Silva

 A fully parametric, low cost, free software compatible and open hardware 3D printer.
 The mechanical structure of the printer is produced by laser-cutting wood based on vector curves generated from the sources written in the OpenSCAD geometry description language. The design is fully parametric, meaning that by tweaking the parameters and rebuilding the sources one can manufacture a variant of this machine with an arbitrary build volume.

 Approximatelly 130 units of this printer have been manufactured up to now in Brazil and the design is showcased in the OpenSCAD website as a notable use of the scripting CAD language.
